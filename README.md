# AdventYour

App lets users browse available devotionals, view details about them, choose them (from the list menu or the details) and then see today's devotionals on the home page.

I've generally focused on polishing the core functionality in terms of UX rather than fleshing out additional functionality.

Additional features and improvements might include-
- Time travel: viewing previous days' devotionals.
- Marking devotionals as 'read' so their card on the homepage is faded out and at the bottom of the list.
- From a UI standpoint the 'ADD' button on the devotional details page isn't quite right -- something else on the page should change when it is pressed to make the action seem as effectual as the use of a large, bright buttons suggests it will be. As it currently is a toggle button might make more sense.
- The progress bar shown on the homepage when JSON requests are pending should also feature on the devotionals list page, and the devotionals details page, in the same scenarios.

Markwon library used to render markdown text.
Picasso library used to fetch images from web addresses.
MaterialProgressBar library used for a better looking / easier to handle progress bar than the default Android one.

Time spent on project: ~17 hours.
